# HandsToYourself

HandsToYourself is a [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod that allows you to toggle whether you are climbable or not.

Now you may be asking "Cyro!! Why not just use LogiX! It's totally possible!"

Well, I *wanted* to do it in LogiX, but the solution was much messier than just adding a `LocomotionGrip` component to the user root.

In any case, enjoy not being bugged any longer. <3
